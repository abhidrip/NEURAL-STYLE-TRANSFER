This project implements Neural Style Transfer (NST) â€” an exciting deep learning technique that blends the content of one image with the artistic style of another. 
In this repository, youâ€™ll find a clean, well-commented PyTorch notebook that demonstrates NST step-by-step:

Load your content image (e.g., a photo)

Load your style image (e.g., a painting)

Use a pre-trained VGG19 network to extract features

Compute content and style losses

Iteratively update a copy of the content image to match the desired style

Save and visualize the stylized output

#ðŸ“‚ Features

âœ… Uses VGG19 as a feature extractor
âœ… Adjustable layers for content and style loss
âœ… Supports both CPU and GPU (CUDA)
âœ… Optimized version to prevent GPU memory overflow
âœ… Easy to tweak weights and training steps
âœ… Clean, beginner-friendly code with explanations
